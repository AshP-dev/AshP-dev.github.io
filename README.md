## Projects

### LiDAR-based system for vehicle assistance. | Python, Open CV, TensorFlow, NumPy, Pandas
• Visualized 3D point cloud data from a Velodyne-HDL sensor using a multistep model with 79.80% accuracy to
identify and classify obstacles and pedestrians on the road and sidewalks.
• A combination of RAN SAC segmentation, DB SCAN clustering and Decision Trees was used to provide an estimated
distance from the identified object.
• Three goals were 100% achieved in this project - Point Cloud Data Manipulation, Vehicle Detection, and Vehicle
Position Estimation
• Placed in the top 7 and received a special mention in a college seminar in front of a panel of external industry
specialists and affiliate professors.

### Analysis of Path Segmentation algorithms based on DeepLabV3 | Python, Open CV, TensorFlow, NumPy, Pandas
• Designed two modified algorithms having backbone architectures of MobileNetV2 and Xception65 respectively
resulting in a comparative analysis of both models.
• Extrapolated findings with MobileNetV2 and Xception65 giving pixel accuracy of 0.90720 and 0.93265 respectively.

### College Collab Portal | React.js , Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB
• Designed a project collaboration portal for programmers using MERN and linked user profiles to Git Hub, enabling
users to display their repositories on their profile and market themselves to potential collaborators.
